                    <p> I am ready for the road less traveled. Already <a href=""> brushing off the dust.</a> Yeah,
                        you're lucky if
                        you're on her plane. I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath. Uh, She’s a beast. I call her
                        Karma (come back). Black ray-bans, you know she's with the band. I can't sleep let's run away
                        and don't ever look back, don't ever look back.
                    </p>

                    <p> I'm intrigued, for a peek, heard it's fascinating. Oh oh! Wanna be a victim ready for abduction.
                        She's got that international smile, oh yeah, she's got that one international smile. Do you ever
                        feel, feel so paper thin. I’m gon’ put her in a coma. Sun-kissed skin so hot we'll melt your
                        popsicle.
                    </p>
                    <p> This is transcendental, on another level, boy, you're my lucky star. </p>

                    <p> From Tokyo to Mexico, to Rio. Yeah, you take me to utopia. I'm walking on air. We'd make out in
                        your Mustang to Radiohead. I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one. Sun-kissed skin so hot
                        we'll melt your popsicle. Slow cooking pancakes for my boy, still up, still fresh as a Daisy.

                    <p> Don't need apologies. Boy, you're an alien your touch so foreign, it's supernatural,
                        extraterrestrial. Talk about our future like we had a clue. I can feel a phoenix inside of me.
